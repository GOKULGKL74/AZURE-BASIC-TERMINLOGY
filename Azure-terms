What is cloud computing?
  delivery compute service via internet.


Cloud architect/models   -Private,public,hybid

	private/onpremis -traditional/single organisation using private cloud,
		 completely private,better security,cost(own vm,maintanance,power...)
		 more responsibility nd less flexiblity  [CapX]-large invetments,maintain

	public - azure,aws,google.....[OpX]-rent,consumption based,pay as u go
		  purchase resource nd use it without any investment,more felxibity(which resource need use it),vendor responsiblity fr their hardware

	hybrid - combine both environments private nd pub via VPN,expressroute
		  run workloads in most appropriate loc
		  combine dif private cloud also,most flexibility
		  eg :company needs to store in sensitive data in private nd additional storage in public

Cloud service types:
Iaas   -basic computing infrastructure
	-responsible for:datacenter,network,physical server(VM),storage
	hypervisor(infrastructure) host VMs [hyperv,VMware]
	more responsiblity

Paas   -pre-packaed cloud service [manage al physical aspects of IAAS  nd os]-app service
	build on top of IAAS with os nd tools(dev tools)
	manage develop/deploymnet service
	focus on soln** not infrastructure** Bz cloud vendor take care of infras
	eg:mysql
	serverless:(advanced version)--run code without infras managemnet 	
saas   -ready to use application  [subscription]

Defense  - 7 layers of security
	physical security(hardware access),--cloud vendor tke care
	identity nd acces(identity to logon),
	perimeter(netwrk based attacks,firewalls/DDoSpotection),
	network (connection),
	compute(secure vm(iaas)),
	application(secrets to access app),data

virtual machine
	its IAAS
	Virtualised server:hosted on underlyig hypervisor
			   user has full control
	software-based emulation of a physical computer

VIRTUALIZATION :
	install hypervisor on top of server .
	hypervisor divide the physical serve to number of individual server

HYPERVISOR:
	Installled in physical server and divides the physical server into n server
API
	API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

Region:
	GRP of datacenter
	independenet on each other

How to choose region?
	to minimize latency(near by users loc)
	Feature(not al feature availble for all loc)
	price
region pair:
	2 closely linked region for redutancy except brazil
		each region s paired(dis 300 miles away)
		outage failure (can resolve)
		planned updtes	at 1 time and another 	
		replication
sovereign region
	isolated region in govenment(china ,us)future-russia

availability zone
	physically seperated datacenter within azure region
	min 1 r more datacenetr/zone 
	each zone has seperte datacenter,power,netwrk[if any failure/traffc can access other with the hlp of LB]
	each datacenter has independnt
	TYPES:ZONAL(SPECIFIC),ZONE REDUDANT
	
	zone redudant service-automatically replicates acros zone(more cost bz more zone)

scaling:
horizontal-automatic/dynamic-autoscale*-elasticity*
vertical-manual

Horizontal -out/in
	add vm load balancer distributed the traffic 
	automatic,no downtime
vertical  -up/down
	increase compute resourse (add ram,cpu..)
	manual,req downtime 
VM SCALE SET(up t0 1000vm)at 0 cost
	->add identical vm automatically if more traffic     with d help of load balancer(horizontal scaling)
	->single region in dff zone

disaster recovery: backup
	restoring data if disater hpn

autoscale-automaticlly add/remove VM from scale set when traffic hits /slow down

reliabilty:
	ability to recover from accident with less down time
	no single point of failure
	if one computer down other pick the load

predictivity
	consistent performance (autoscale),u knw cost as expect
security:
	control of security involvement
governance:
	tools to enforce company requiremnets
managibility
	tools contol cloud resource	
load balancing:
	Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

Resource manager-create resourse
resourse grp(mandatory): grouping resource  -to track,to manage
region -->availability zone--->datacentr(1+)
